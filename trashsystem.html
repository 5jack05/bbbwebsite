<h2>Single-Stream Recycling</h2>
<p>Single-stream recycling is a process where instead of the depositor sorting the materials, the materials are collected and sorted by facility workers/machines.
This provides multiple advantages, where it takes less time for the citizen to deposit materials while dedicated sorters sort the materials properly.
It also costs less, because trucks that collect materials are more efficient to operate when the only have to carry one type versus multiple.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, disadvantages could include that processing costs more to sort out everything instead of multiple types (which are more easily sorted).
Materials can be cross-contaminated and become non-reusable (or at least, the commercial price will be lowered);
and public confidence can be lowered by most of the materials being sent to landfills in contrast to multiple streams.
</p>
<p>All in all, single-stream recycling is used by most facilities and citizens nowadays due to its overall simplicity.
Multiple-stream recycling is also used, but it tends to be more complicated due to taking more time (untrained sorters, i.e. citizens) and just costing more over-all.

<h2>The Reusage and Recycling Loop</h2>
<p>When you dispose of items, they have to go somewhere, right? Well, after the trucks deliver your trash, they end up at one of 3 places:
A recycling facility, a waste-to-energy facility, or a land fill. The recycling facility is the biggest chain, and the one we'll talk about first.
</p>
<h3>Recycling Facility</h3>
<p>In a recycling facility; most of them handle paper, plastic, and glass. Paper is sorted by corrugated (as in cardboard-like), newspapers, mixed paper (all of the common stuff), and an office mix (all kinds of paper used in a workplace).
They get baled (dried so that water doesn't make them damp and soggy), and then shipped off to paper mills to be reused again.
Newspapers are special due to the special ink that's on them, so they wash and rinse it in water until it looks plain with no more ink on it. This also coincidentally separates short-fiber newspapers from the long-fiber ones.
At the mill,
